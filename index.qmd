# Biography

I am a second-year student at Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD), pursuing BSc in Mathematics. As a first-generation university student, I am honored to be a recipient of the Brunei Darussalam Government Scholarship for Foreign Students (BDGS), recognizing my commitment to academic excellence and leadership.

I aspire to contribute to projects that applies mathematical methods in solving global challenges. A recent project of mine,  [*Spatial Autocorelation of Schools*](https://alvinbjl.github.io/spatial-autocorrelation-school/), supervised by [Dr. Haziq Jamil](https://haziqj.ml), examined the  spatial distributions of schools in Brunei using R programming language. Datasets from this work contributed to the development of the {bruneimap} package. 

Currently, I am exploring climate data analysis and expanding my technical skills by learning Python. Outside of academics, I stay active through sports, particularly swimming, table tennis, and badminton. Whether I‚Äôm coding, in the pool, or on the court, I am always eager to learn, grow and make a meaningful impact!
