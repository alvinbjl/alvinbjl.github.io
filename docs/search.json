As part of the logistics team, I handle venue coordination, seating arrangements, and equipment setup to ensure meetups run smoothly and offer a seamless, enjoyable experience for all participants.\nI served as the speaker for the group’s first 2025 meetup, where I delivered a talk on Spatial Data Analysis using the newly released {bruneimap} package. As a contributor to the package, I showcased its key features: Brunei spatial boundaries & datasets, and demonstrated practical applications and visualization built using this data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNBT Brunei (Inchcape): Finance Clerk\nDuring my transition from A-Levels to university, I was grateful to secure my first corporate role as a Finance Clerk at NBT. In this role, I was responsible for tax analysis, extracting financial data from Autoline software, importing it into MS Excel for categorization and cleaning, and filling in missing details such as reasons and sources. This process ensured accurate tax classification and compliance with financial regulations. Additionally, I assisted in training the India team on the same tax analysis procedures, ensuring consistency and accuracy across teams.\nBeyond tax and expense tracking, I led the implementation of MS Power BI for financial analysis, developing interactive dashboards for expenditure tracking and credit note evaluations. I also guided the Customer Relations department in building their own dashboards to track customer complaints and satisfaction metrics, improving their ability to analyze trends and enhance service quality. These dashboards were later used in presentations and meetings, providing insights that supported decision-making and strategic planning.\nIn addition to these key projects, I also handled administrative tasks of issuing cheques, writing meeting minutes, and restructuring financial documentation. I revised the formats for claim forms, leave forms, discount approval forms, payment vouchers (PV), and supplier vouchers (SV) to improve clarity and efficiency in financial processing."

I remember staying late after school for training, driven by the goal of joining the national team and competing internationally. After years of dedication and perseverance, I earned a spot on the national team in 2018 and was honored to represent Brunei in the ASEAN School Games in 2018 and 2019. I retired from competitive swimming in 2020 to focus on my professional life.\nThe greatest lesson I took from swimming is the importance of discipline, committing to a routine, and pushing through challenges."

Over time, I became more involved and was appointed Secretary and Vice Chair of the club. In these role, I collaborate closely with the Chair in strategic planning and execution of club’s vision by coordinating events and supporting members as well as managing club documentation (membership records, club proposals, meeting minutes).\nIn February 2025, I was selected to represent my university in the Chancellor’s Trophy (Inter-University Games) for doubles table tennis event, where my partner and I secured 1st place. Transitioning from an individual sport (swimming) to a team-based one, taught me the value of teamwork, and how to adapt, communicate, and coordinate effectively with a partner to achieve a shared goal."
