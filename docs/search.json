As a first-generation university student, I am honored to be a recipient of the Brunei Darussalam Government Scholarship for Foreign Students (BDGS), recognizing my commitment to academic excellence and leadership.\nI aspire to contribute to projects that applies mathematical methods in solving global challenges. A recent project of mine, Spatial Autocorelation of Schools, supervised by Dr.¬†Haziq Jamil, examined the spatial distributions of schools in Brunei using R programming language. Datasets from this work contributed to the development of the {bruneimap} package.\nCurrently, I am exploring climate data analysis and expanding my technical skills by learning Python. Outside of academics, I stay active through sports, particularly swimming, table tennis, and badminton. Whether I‚Äôm coding, in the pool, or on the court, I am always eager to learn, grow and make a meaningful impact!\nMore About me!\n\n\n\n\n\nData Analysis\nEducation\nLinear Algebra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBSc in Mathematics  Universiti of Brunei Darussaalam (UBD)\nGCE A‚ÄôLevel (3A*)  Self-taught (Private Candidate)\nGCE O‚ÄôLevel (9A*)  Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB"

I remember staying late after school for training, driven by the goal of joining the national team and competing internationally. After years of dedication and perseverance, I earned a spot on the national team in 2018 and was honored to represent Brunei in the ASEAN School Games in 2018 and 2019. I retired from competitive swimming in 2020 to focus on my professional life.\nThe greatest lesson I took from swimming is the importance of discipline, committing to a routine, and pushing through challenges."

Over time, I became more involved and was appointed Secretary and Vice Chair of the club. In these role, I collaborate closely with the Chair in strategic planning and execution of club‚Äôs vision by coordinating events and supporting members as well as managing club documentation (membership records, club proposals, meeting minutes).\nIn February 2025, I was selected to represent my university in the Chancellor‚Äôs Trophy (Inter-University Games) for doubles table tennis event, where my partner and I secured 1st place. Transitioning from an individual sport (swimming) to a team-based one, taught me the value of teamwork, and how to adapt, communicate, and coordinate effectively with a partner to achieve a shared goal."
