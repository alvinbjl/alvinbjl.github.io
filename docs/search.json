    "text": "I am a second-year student at Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD), pursuing BSc in Mathematics. As a first-generation university student, I am honored to be a recipient of the Brunei Darussalam Government Scholarship for Foreign Students (BDGS), recognizing my commitment to academic excellence and leadership.\nMy interests lie in bridging mathematical theory with practical applications, particularly in linear algebra, statistical data analysis, and mathematical modeling. My recent project, Spatial Autocorelation of Schools, supervised by Prof. Haziq Jamil, explored the distributions of schools in Brunei using R programming language. I am expanding my expertise by learning Python and delving into advanced linear algebra for climate data analysis. I also look forward to contributing to the Brunei R Community in my upcoming projects.\nOutside of my studies, I am actively involved in sports, including swimming, table tennis, and badminton. I aspire to contribute to impactful projects addressing pressing global challenges and am always eager to learn, collaborate, and make a difference.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Algebra\nStatistical Data Analysis\nClimate Data Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBSc in Mathematics  Universiti of Brunei Darussaalam (UBD)\nGCE A’Level (3A*)  Self-taught (Private Candidate)\nGCE O’Level (9A*)  Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB"
